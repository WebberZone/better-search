Better Search replaces the default WordPress search with a better search engine that gives contextual results sorted by relevance

## Description

[Better Search](https://webberzone.com/plugins/better-search/) replaces the default WordPress search engine with a more powerful search engine that gives search results relevant to the title and content of the post. This means that visitors to your blog will find what they are looking for quicker than if you didn't have __Better Search__ installed.

Better Search can search through not just posts, but also pages and other custom post types. Let your visitors find what they are looking for.

The plugin is packed with options to allow you to easily customise the output. You can also fine tune the results by assigning a greater weight to either the title or the content. The default mode is a seamless integration with your WordPress theme. And, for power users, Better Search supports templates for that extra something.

And for even more advanced users, Better Search is packed with filters and actions that allow you to easily extend the plugin's feature set.

Additionally, the plugin also tracks the searches and you to display a "search heatmap" of the most popular searches. Support for WordPress widgets will allow you to easily add this heatmap to your theme's sidebar or footer.

### Features

* __Automatic__: Once activated, Better Search will automatically replace your default WordPress search with more relevant search results
* __Seamless integration__: Search results are perfectly integrated into your theme without the need for custom search templates
* __Relevance__: Search results are automatically sorted by relevance. You can also turn off relevancy based searching, in which case, results are sorted by date
* __Control the results__: Search within title, content, excerpt, meta fields, authors, tags and other taxonomies and comments
* __Popular searches__: Find out what visitors are searching for on your blog. Display a list of popular search terms (daily and overall) on your blog in the form of a heatmap. Widget support for easy integration in your theme as well as a shortcode [[bsearch_heatmap]]
* __Customisation__: Use your own template file for perfect integration into your blog template. Input your own CSS styles in the *Custom Styles* tab in the Settings Page. Check the FAQ for more information
* __Supports cache plugins__: Works with caching plugins like WP-Super-Cache and W3 Total Cache
* __Profanity filter__: Customise the list of stop words that will automatically be filtered out of search queries
* __Translation ready__: Better Search is translation ready
