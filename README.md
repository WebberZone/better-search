## mySQL FULLTEXT indices

On activation, the plugin creates three mySQL FULLTEXT indices (or indexes) in the `*_posts` table. These are for `post_content`, `post_title` and `(post_title,post_content)`. If youâ€™re running a multisite installation, then this is created for each of the blogs on activation. All these indices occupy space in your mySQL database but are essential for the plugin to run.
