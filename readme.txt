Better Search replaces the default WordPress search with a better search engine that gives contextual results sorted by relevance.

Better Search gives you complete control over your site’s search results. Fine-tune relevance, search across different fields and post types, track popular queries, and customise the output — all without writing a single line of code.

## MySQL FULLTEXT indices

Better Search adds the following MySQL FULLTEXT indices to the `wp_posts` table:

* `post_content`
* `post_title`
* `(post_title, post_content)`

On multisite, these are added to each blog upon activation. These indices power the relevance-based search and are required for full functionality.

= Will this work with any WordPress theme? =  
Yes! It replaces the default WordPress search and integrates with most themes out of the box.

= Does it support WooCommerce or custom post types? =  
Yes, you can enable searching in any public post type from the settings.

= How does it affect performance? =  
Better Search uses MySQL FULLTEXT indexes and includes internal caching. It also works well with external caching plugins.

= Can I customise the search results template? =  
Yes, you can override the results template by copying the file to your theme directory. More info in the [documentation](https://webberzone.com/support/knowledgebase/better-search-templates/).

It filters out selected keywords from being searched. Handy for family-safe sites.

Better Search includes a very cool profanity filter using the script from [Banbuilder](https://github.com/snipe/banbuilder). You can customize which list of words you want to filter out from the Better Search settings page. Find the setting called "Filter these words:". The plugin will automatically strip out partial and complete references to these words. You can turn the filter off by emptying the list.
