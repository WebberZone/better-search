= mySQL FULLTEXT indices =

On activation, the plugin creates three mySQL FULLTEXT indices (or indexes) in the `*_posts` table. These are for `post_content`, `post_title` and `(post_title,post_content)`. If youâ€™re running a multisite installation, then this is created for each of the blogs on activation. All these indices occupy space in your mySQL database but are essential for the plugin to run.

= Contribute =
Better Search is also available on [Github](https://github.com/WebberZone/better-search)
So, if you've got some cool feature that you'd like to implement into the plugin or a bug you've been able to fix, consider forking the project and sending me a pull request.

= Can I customize the output? =

Better Search has a huge set of options that help you customize the output or fine tune the results without leaving the comfort of your WordPress site. Goto **Settings > Better Search** to configure.

The plugin also supports the use of template files within your theme. You can create a file called `better-search-template.php` in your theme's directory and the plugin will use it to display the results.

= My search words are getting filtered or *How does the profanity filter work* =

Better Search includes a very cool profanity filter using the script from [Banbuilder](https://github.com/snipe/banbuilder). You can customize which list of words you want to filter out from the Better Search settings page. Find the setting called "Filter these words:". The plugin will automatically strip out both partial and complete references of these words.
You can turn the filter off by emptying the list.
